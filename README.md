## :person_red_hair: About me
I'm Kay, a Full Stack Software Developer who has taken an extended career break to raise my children for the past 11 years, but parenting and home-educating aside, I've also been working on my skills so I can return to the workforce.

In 2020, I decided to rediscover my love of learning and do another degree in Chemistry. Prior to that I had been self-studying A-Level Maths in my free-time. Come 2022, full of confidence and ambition from two years of successful, intensive learning, I realised what I really love most about science is problem-solving and using computers to solve complex problems, like protein-folding a la DeepMind. This encouraged me to take the plunge into exploring coding as a career option and I quickly discovered that coding really suited my particular skills. For me, being a good developer is to have the mind of a scientist with the heart of an artist, and I think this describes me perfectly! With this in mind, I applied for a software engineering course, and the rest, as they say is history!

Having graduated from Makers, I am keen to further my knowledge and expand my skillset. I have continued to learn, creating small projects, studying a course in REACT, learning TypeScript and will soon be starting an evening class in Web Development with Code First Girls. My goal is to make a meaningful impact in the world through coding and to serve as an advocate and inspiration for underrepresented groups, particularly women, to encourage others to pursue a career in technology

Coding is a constantly evolving field that allows me to learn something new every day, to exercise my problem-solving abilities, and to tap into my creativity. I am eager to join a forward-thinking, technology-driven company where I can continue to learn and grow, and to see what we can accomplish together.

### Ernst & Young (June 2010 - June 2012)

- Managed and maintained client accounts, including preparing self-assessment tax returns
- Proven track record of high-quality and accurate work under time pressure, resulting in two promotions within a just over a year.
- Demonstrated exceptional work ethic and attention to detail, resulting in me being the first port of call for urgent and complex work. 
- Showed the ability to lead, by delivering induction training, mentoring and support to 10 new starters with just 24 hours notice.

## **Trainee Auditor Graduate Scheme**
### **The Audit Commission** (September 2009 - June 2010)  

- Ensured the accuracy and compliance of financial accounts by performing audits and reviewing financial records.
- Developed effective communication and interpersonal skills by regularly liaising with a diverse range of clients in their workplace.
- Demonstrated a strong understanding of business and financial management by successfully passing related exams.

## **Stock Market Data Analyst (Swiss, Austrian & Luxembourg Exchanges)**
### **Thomson Reuters** (September 2007 - September 2009)  

- A highly technical role within a fast-paced and high-pressure environment, responsible for ensuring the integrity of stock exchange data.

## :trophy: Skills 
### Communication

I possess exceptional communication skills, including a proven ability to produce high-quality technical reports and documentation, as demonstrated in my Chemistry degree and repository READMEs [(see Bank Tech Test)](https://github.com/kwatts949/banking_app). While working at Thomson Reuters, I was also responsible for writing and updating highly technical process documentation, which required exceptional clarity and concision in my communication. Additionally, I am an effective oral communicator, having studied multiple languages and worked with teams from diverse cultural backgrounds, including those with limited English proficiency. I am known for my ability to clearly convey complex information and this was very useful during my time at Makers, where I was able to explain coding concepts effectively to my pair partners.
  
### Problem-solving

I am an accomplished problem-solver who thrives on the challenge of finding solutions where others may struggle. My experience at Ernst & Young is a testament to this, as I was able to identify and implement changes to our team's new starter induction process, resulting in increased productivity.

My time at Makers further developed my problem-solving skills by exposing me to a variety of coding challenges, where I learned the value of taking the time to thoughtfully diagram and plan solutions. I believe that my ability to take a step back and approach challenges methodically, rather than diving in impulsively, is what makes me an effective problem-solver.

### Accuracy & precision

I am extremely detail-oriented and take great care to ensure that all of my work is accurate and precise. This is reflected in my Chemistry degree, where I have received perfect scores on several assignments. Furthermore, I have experience working with live data feeds whilst at Thomson Reuters, where precision and error-checking are crucial.

In addition, whilst working in Tax at Ernst & Young, I would often be assigned urgent work with a very tight timeframe as I was respected for my ability to produce very high quality work with minimal errors. 

I have been able to transfer these skills easily to coding, and have found that I am able to produce high quality, reliable and consistent code with minimal errors. Additionally, I have found that paying attention to accuracy and precision makes for more easily maintainable code that is easier to debug.

### Teamwork

I am a strong believer in the power of teamwork. In my experience, a dedicated team can always accomplish more than individuals alone. My time at Makers honed my team-playing skills and I found team projects to be particularly enjoyable. Through working with a diverse range of individuals, I was able to contribute my strengths and learn from others in areas where I am weaker. 

My experience in previous employment has been characterized by a strong emphasis on teamwork, both in local and remote settings. I have also had the opportunity to mentor and train new team members, leveraging my knowledge to enhance team efficiency and effectiveness. One notable experience was while working at Thomson Reuters, where the majority of projects were team-based. These included small teams of four working on specific exchange data as well as large, multi-national projects, where I collaborated with individuals from various countries. Through my contributions, I was able to make a significant impact and was recognized with an award for the success of the final project.

### Love of learning
My quest in life is to learn something new every day and I am passionate about improving outcomes through learning - I volunteer at my local secondary school, improving the quality of their resources to enrich the experience of students. I also have an inherent desire to challenge myself and develop further. 

Last year, I homeschooled my daughter full-time whilst maintaining First Class scores in my Chemistry degree, learning to code and picking up the piano as an adult beginner. This provided me with a quite enormous and unexpected learning opportunity, where I had to refine my time-management and organisational skills, learn lots of patience and empathy, as well as the entire Year 6 & 7 curriculums along with my own study material! When I took my daughter out of school, she was really struggling with Maths and didn't even know her times tables. I provided a safe, effective learning environment for her and she has returned to Year 6 this year, achieving top scores, receiving an award for Maths and been entered into a National Mathematics competition. It has been a real treat to share my love of learning with her and receive such great results!

I'm continuing to learn this year and so far, I've been extending my knowledge of REACT, I'm going to take a course in web development in February and plan on learning at least one new programming language - I'm also looking forward to adding to this list!
