## :person_red_hair: About me
I'm Kay, I'm a Full Stack Software Developer who has taken an extended career break to raise my children for the past 11 years, but parenting and home-educating aside, I've been working on my skillset so I can launch myself back into the workforce fully prepped!

Unlike 99% of the population, I was born with a highly gifted IQ, but that's only good if you do something with it. Fortunately, that didnt stop me from burning out completely in my teens. Even better, it took me a long while to regain my confidence and realise that I was enough. For the last couple of years I've been using my skills to revisit learning and achieve the goals I set for myself. 

In 2020, I decided to rediscover my love of learning and do another degree in Chemistry. Prior to that I had been self-studying A-Level Maths in my free-time. Come 2022, full of confidence and ambition from two years of successful intensive learning, I realised what I really love most about science is problem-solving, using computers to solve complex problems, like protein-folding a la DeepMind.

Having recently graduated from Makers, I am keen to further my knowledge and expand my skillset. I have continued to learn, creating small projects, studying a course in REACT and will soon be starting an evening class in Web Development with Code First Girls. 

Coding gives me the opportunity to learn something new every day, to problem-solve to my hearts content, and challenge my brain and creativity in ways I couldn't have imagined. I'm looking to work in an exciting, progressive, tech-led company and see what we can achieve together.

## :trophy: Skills 
### Communication

I possess strong communication skills, with a proven ability to write high-quality technical reports and documentation. I am known for my ability to convey information clearly and concisely, and I am also an effective oral communicator, having studied multiple languages and worked with teams from diverse cultural backgrounds.

### Problem-solving

I'm a proven effective problem-solver. I live for the challenge of finding solutions where others can't. In my job at Ernst & Young, I indentified and helped implement changes we could make to the way new starters were inducted into our team to make them more productive quicker.

### Accuracy & precision

I am extremely detail-oriented and take great care to ensure that all of my work is accurate and precise. This is reflected in my Chemistry degree, where I have received perfect scores on several assignments. Furthermore, I have experience working with live data feeds, where precision and error-checking are crucial.

### Love of learning
My quest in life is to learn something new every day and I am a huge advocate for education - I volunteer at my local secondary school, improving the quality of their resources to enrich the experience of students. I have an inherent desire to challenge myself and be better. This year, I've learnt to code and begun playing the piano - I'm excited to see what next year will bring!
