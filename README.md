## About me
I'm Kay, I've taken been taking an extended career break to raise my children for the past 11 years, but parenting and home-educating aside, I've been working on my skillset so I can launch myself back into the workforce fully prepped!

Unlike 99% of the population, I was born with a highly gifted IQ, but that's only good if you do something with it. Fortunately, that didnt stop me from burning out completely in my teens. Even better, it took me a long while to regain my confidence and realise that I was enough. For the last couple of years I've been using my skills to revisit learning and achieve the goals I set for myself. 

In 2020, I decided to rediscover my love of learning and do another degree in Chemistry. Prior to that I had been self-studying A-Level Maths in my free-time. Come 2022, full of confidence and ambition from two years of successful intensive learning, I realised what I really love most about science is problem-solving, using computers to solve complex problems, like protein-folding a la DeepMind.

I'm now ready for a new challenge, to explore something I've long wanted to do. Coding gives me the opportunity to learn something new every day, to problem-solve to my hearts content, and challenge my brain and creativity in ways I couldn't have imagined. I'm looking to work in an exciting, progressive, tech-led company and see what we can achieve together.

## Skills
### Communication

I have considerable experience in writing high quality technical reports and new starter documentation. I have often been praised for my clean, clear and concise wording. I am an excellent oral communicator, having studied several languages and have worked effectively in many local and international teams spanning different cultures.

### Problem-solving

I'm a proven effective problem-solver. I live for the challenge of finding solutions where others can't. In my job at Ernst & Young, I indentified and helped implement changes we could make to the way new starters were inducted into our team to make them more productive quicker.

### Accuracy & precision

I ensure that all work I complete is highly accurate and precise. Within my Chemistry degree, I have achieved a score of 100% on several assignments due to the impeccable quality of my work. Additionally, I have worked with live data feeds where the smallest error could result in catastrophic effects on the data feed integrity. As such, I have considerable experience in error-checking and ensuring accuracy.

### Love of learning
My quest in life is to learn something new every day and I am a huge advocate for education - I volunteer at my local secondary school, improving the quality of their resources to enrich the experience of students. I have an inherent desire to challenge myself and be better. This year, I've learnt to code and begun playing the piano - I'm excited to see what next year will bring!
